    <body>Greetings #PLAYERNAME#,
Congratulations on completing Hacknet: Traced! This extension was the largest extension I've ever made, and I've learned a lot of things from it.

Big thanks to Fayti1703 for the colossal number of questions I asked him, and to RubberDuckShobe for some playtesting.

This extension was created over 38 days and I had a lot of fun making it.


Thanks for playing!
Samaritan
