    <body>Hello.
Your name is #PLAYERNAME#, is it not? I would like to ask you to stay quiet about me hacking into your system, okay? Good. It's not like you have a choice anyway.

You will be subjected to multiple trials that you will complete for me. It can be anything, even if it incriminates you or your friends at Ghosts.
This is your first trial.

A news site, FuzzFeed, has been posting some... fake news. It would be best to remove those files before someone is harmed by following them.
Remove all news articles on the server and delete the config.sys file. Reply when you are done.
