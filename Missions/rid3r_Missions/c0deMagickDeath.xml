    <body>So.
You've seen what happens to your friend if they poke around too far.
Thankfully that pacemaker is a decoy. He's alive. I'd never kill a person just to make a point.

I'd like to welcome you into our contract hub. Complete contracts and you can access harder ones.
I'm also giving you access to our assets server. The tools there should help you. I made them myself. Wasn't too hard, by the way.

I look forward to seeing you take some contracts.
