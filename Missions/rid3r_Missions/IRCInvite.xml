    <body>Well well, #PLAYERNAME#,
It seems you've really helped me protect against my fellow users and most importantly my friends. I think you've earned it, so I've removed your existence from the evidence file you uploaded to the police server. You are safe.

I'd like to talk with you again, so I'm linking an IRC to you. Please join as soon as possible.
