    <body>Hey, are you alright?
I know that Unite was one of the first people you met, but I assure you that he is nothing but evil. They all are.

The fact that you destroyed his system goes to show that you believe me and want to take Ghosts down. Thank you.
The best way to cripple them is to delete their entire mainframe's files. If all of their files go, they won't be able to recover.
Unfortunately they've stolen some code from a biotech company's servers and incorporated it into their mainframe. That means you'll have to crack that port as well.
Fortunately for us, I know where we could get the cracker for it. The company developed a port tester, a stresser that sends junk data to the port to see how much it could take before crashing.

Find that file.
People's lives depend on it.
