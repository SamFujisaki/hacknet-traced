    <body>#PLAYERNAME#,
I cannot thank you enough for the help you have given me. It's great to see an organisation like Ghosts fall to the ground.
Something I didn't anticipate happened though. The mainframe had a backup server, and it sent logs of my conversation with you about the Hacknet project to a core server, of which is owned by the company I work for.
They'll see it and try to stop me. I won't be stopped, even if it kills me.

I think that in the event of something like that to happen, I should add a contingency plan into a random copy of Hacknet and distribute it.
How does "My name is Bit, and if you're reading this, I'm already dead." sound?
