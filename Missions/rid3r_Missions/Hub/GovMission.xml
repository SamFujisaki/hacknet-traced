    <body>The US government has always had special security measures in place to make sure that hackers and the like don't get into their networks. It turns out that a vulnerability has been found in their "safe and secure" system.

Our group has come under some attacks that hit us hard. All we know is that the hack came from a government IP address. This can only mean one of two things: either a hacker has gained access to the network and is attacking us from behind it, or the government is coming after us.
We want you to find out any sort of information about any hacks. To do this, you'll need two more tools. You can find them both on the assets server. A memory dump from one of our systems has also been uploaded to the assets server. You can use that to find out the source IP.
If you find something, upload it to the /home folder of the assets server.

It is very, *very* important to note now that you must NOT leave ANY tracks on any government system. It would be bad for us, but even worse for you if they caught you.

I'm counting on you.</body>
