This is more of a personal request from c0deMagick, but we should all help each other, right?
He wants to study the source code of a kernel and find out the new changes. Unfortunately, most people are unable to download the source code as it is unreleased.
Fortunately we aren't like most people.

Find the source code and upload it to the home folder of the asset server.
