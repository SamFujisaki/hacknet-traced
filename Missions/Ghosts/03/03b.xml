    <body>#PLAYERNAME#,
This is more of a personal request from UniteSystem, but we should all help each other, right?
He wants to cause some trouble to a game company that have made some... offensive remarks towards a group of individuals.
He doesn't want to forgive this, and wants you to delete some of their WIP game files. He left you a message by the way:
"Destroy the shitshow that is Team of Superstars, it's been delayed and delayed. I'm sick of the fucking thing so let's make sure it never releases."

Tread carefully #PLAYERNAME#, the game company may have security policies that are a lot different than what you've been dealing with so far.
