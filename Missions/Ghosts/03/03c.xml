    <body>Hey #PLAYERNAME#,
This isn't a group mission as such, but rather a personal request from me.

As well as being the admin of Ghosts, I also host puzzle systems. I've created a new one designed for people who want to learn pentesting.
I'd personally like to invite you to test the box out. The objective for you is to download the special application I uploaded there as a reward for you.

Thank you.
