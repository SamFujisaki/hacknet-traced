  <posting title="*Nix Notes System">
All terminal driven operating systems based on the *Nix kernel have a built in notes program (run using "notes") that can be very convenient.
It's generally underused, relatively ram efficient and is well integrated with many mail clients and other programs (so that they can conveniently
autofill notes for you).
    
Running it is as simple as using the "notes" command, notes can be manually added via UI, or using the "addNote [NOTE]" command.
