We are announcing here in this post that from now on we shall be using the new Surreal Engine 5 once Great Games release a stable build to us.

From now on, expect to see all of the new enhancements such as ray-tracing, better post-processing capabilities and other graphical/sound upgrades.

All of us at Unisoft look forward to bringing you the finest quality games in the video game industry!
