### What is Decypher?
Decypher is a tool included in the DEC Solutions encryption suite. It decrypts files that have been encrypted with their Encripter tool.

### Where is Encripter and the other tools in the DEC Solutions encryption suite?
All the other tools are closed-source - you cannot view the source code and edit it. We have decompiled Decypher first and made it open-source for everyone to contribute to.
The other tools in the encryption suite will be made open-source in due time, just give us a few weeks!
