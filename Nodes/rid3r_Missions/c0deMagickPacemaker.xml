If you're reading this, I'm probably dead. Sorry.

I'd just like to talk about the projects we've been doing.
I'm uncertain whether or not the main plan that Ghosts have been working on is a good idea. What is it going to do to benefit us, other than cause destruction and chaos?
That's why in the last message you'll ever see from me is this:

I am leaving Ghosts. Forever.
I will not stand for our mantra. It's making me feel sick now just thinking about what we've done and what it has done to innocent people.

For others reading this, I hope you're being careful.
Very careful.</file>
